- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @An-Average-User

Currently learning how to code Python as a main language, and have a lot to look forward to.
Realistically, if someone is actually reading this file it will be either me from the future,
a nosey classmate who just happened to enter, or someone who actually took interest in my projects.

Either way, i welcome you to whatever interested you to my profile.



personal notes:

When writing this ReadMe file, i barely even understood what a readme file was,
i may be even doing it wrong, anyway.

Future focus will probably land in HTML, Machine Learning, different libraries, and overall, exploring what there is to see.
